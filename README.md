# project-4
I've always wanted to make store management software; so why not make it...

This is largely inspired by my own experience running a pizzeria. Except that was all excel spreadsheets, which can be very fickle and easy to mess up.

Major goals:
1. Track daily sales figures - retrieved from POS stations and ordering platforms (i.e. UberEats, etc.)
2. Track inventory - based on periodic counting and supply shipments
3. Track labor - # of employees X hours per X hourly wage
4. Provide useful statistics and visualization for said data.

These services are all built for managers to input their data.

One thing that I'm definitely not going to do is build any consumer-facing app, i.e. an order platform

This might fundamentally be 3 seperate services, which means they can be setup using micro-service architecture.
